    <h2><a name="chap3"></a>Commerce</h2>
    <img src="images/commerce.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Commerce is the conduct of trade among economic agents. Generally, commerce refers to the exchange of 
       goods, services, or something of value, between businesses or entities. From a broad perspective, 
       nations are concerned with managing commerce in a way that enhances the well-being of citizens, by 
       providing jobs and producing beneficial goods and services.</p>
    <p>Commerce has existed from the moment humans started exchanging goods and services with one another. 
       From the early days of bartering to the creation of currencies to the establishment of trade routes, 
       humans have sought ways to exchange goods and services and build a distribution process around the 
       process of doing so.Today, commerce normally refers to the macroeconomic purchases and sales of goods 
       and services by large organizations at scale. The sale or purchase of a single item by a consumer is 
       defined as a transaction, while commerce refers to all transactions related to the purchase and sale 
       of that item in an economy. Most commerce is conducted internationally and represents the buying and 
       selling of goods between nations.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that commerce does not have the same meaning as "business," but rather is a 
       subset of business. Commerce does not relate to the manufacturing or production process of business but 
       only the distribution process of goods and services. The distribution aspect encompasses a wide array of 
       areas, such as logistical, political, regulatory, legal, social, and economic.</p>

    <h2><a name="chap4"></a>Fashion Designer</h2>
    <img src="images/fashiondes img.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200">
    <p>Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetics, clothing construction and natural beauty to 
       clothing and its accessories. It is influenced by culture and different trends, and has varied over 
       time and place. "A fashion designer creates clothing, including dresses, suits, pants, and skirts, and 
       accessories like shoes and handbags, for consumers. He or she can specialize in clothing, accessory, or 
       jewelry design, or may work in more than one of these areas.</p>
    <p>Ready-to-wear, or prêt-à-porter, clothes are a cross between haute couture and mass market. They are 
       not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. 
       Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. 
       Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period 
       known as Fashion Week. This takes place on a citywide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons 
       of Fashion Week include: spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal.
       Half-way garments are an alternative to ready-to-wear, "off-the-peg", or prêt-à-porter fashion. Half-way garments are intentionally unfinished pieces of clothing that encourages co-design between the "primary designer" of the garment, and what would usually be considered, the passive "consumer".[9] This differs from ready-to-wear fashion, as the consumer is able to participate in the process of making and co-designing their clothing. During the Make{able} workshop, Hirscher and Niinimaki found that personal involvement in the garment-making process created a meaningful “narrative” for the user, which established a person-product attachment and increased the sentimental value of the final product.  
       Otto von Busch also explores half-way garments and fashion co-design in his thesis, "Fashion-able, 
       Hacktivism and engaged Fashion Design"</p>
    <p>Most fashion houses in the United States are based in New York City, with a high concentration centered 
       in the Garment District neighborhood. On the US west coast, there is also a significant number of 
       fashion houses in Los Angeles, where a substantial percentage of high fashion clothing manufactured 
       in the United States is actually made. Beverly Hills, particularly on Rodeo Drive, is globally renowned 
       for its fashion design and prestigious shopping. Burgeoning industries in Miami, Chicago, Dallas, and 
       especially San Francisco have developed as well. A semi-annual event held every February and September, 
       New York Fashion Week, is the oldest of the four major fashion weeks held throughout the world. Parsons 
       The New School for Design, located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan in New York 
       City, is considered one of the top fashion schools in the world. There are numerous fashion magazines 
       published in the United States and distributed to a global readership. Examples include Vogue, Harper’s 
       Bazaar, and Cosmopolitan.</p>

    <h2><a name="chap5"></a>Architecture</h2>
    <img src="images/architecture img.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200">
    <p>Architecture is the art and science of designing buildings and other physical structures. A wider 
       definition often includes the design of the total built environment from the macro level of town 
       planning, urban design, and landscape architecture to the micro level of construction details and, 
       sometimes, furniture.The practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a way of 
       expressing culture for civilizations on all seven continents. For this reason, architecture is 
       considered to be a form of art. Texts on architecture have been written since ancient time. The 
       earliest surviving text on architectural theory is the 1st century AD treatise De architectura by the 
       Roman architect Vitruvius, according to whom a good building embodies firmitas, utilitas, and venustas 
       (durability, utility, and beauty). Centuries later, Leon Battista Alberti developed his ideas further, 
       seeing beauty as an objective quality of buildings to be found in their proportions. Giorgio Vasari 
       wrote Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects and put forward the idea of style 
       in the Western arts in the 16th century. In the 19th century, Louis Sullivan declared that "form follows 
       function". "Function" began to replace the classical "utility" and was understood to include not only 
       practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural dimensions. The idea of sustainable architecture 
       was introduced in the late 20th century.</p>
    <p>Architecture began as rural, oral vernacular architecture that developed from trial and error to 
       successful replication. Ancient urban architecture was preoccupied with building religious structures 
       and buildings symbolizing the political power of rulers until Greek and Roman architecture shifted 
       focus to civic virtues. Indian and Chinese architecture influenced forms all over Asia and Buddhist 
       architecture in particular took diverse local flavors. During the European Middle Ages, pan-European 
       styles of Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals and abbeys emerged while the Renaissance favored Classical 
       forms implemented by architects known by name. Later, the roles of architects and engineers became 
       separated. Modern architecture began after World War I as an avant-garde movement that sought to 
       develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order focused on 
       meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. Emphasis was put on modern techniques, materials, 
       and simplified geometric forms, paving the way for high-rise superstructures. Many architects became 
       disillusioned with modernism which they perceived as ahistorical and anti-aesthetic, and postmodern and 
       contemporary architecture developed.</p>

    <h4><a name="chap6"></a>Hotel Management</h4>
    <img src="images/hotel.png" alt="" height="200" width="400">
    <p>Hotel Management courses train students to work in the hospitality sector in various specializations 
       like Hospitality Management, Hotel and Tourism Management, Hotel Administration, and Catering Technology.
       Hotel Management Courses are available as Short-Term Certificate Courses, to full-time diploma hotel 
       management courses, UG and PG hotel management courses with hospitality management, catering service, 
       and tourism as specializations. 
       Hotel Managers in India are likely to observe a salary increase of 12% every 18 months. The revenue 
       generated is expected to show an annual growth rate of 20.47% between the year 2021 – 2025, resulting 
       in a projected market volume of USD 9,626 Million by 2025 in India.</p>
    <p>People with good communication skills must definitely do Hotel Management Courses. Providing a 
       welcoming and friendly environment is one of the top priorities in the sector and this can only be 
       achieved through good communication skills.
       Discipline is extremely important in the sector. Without discipline good service is impossible. 
       The backstage hard work which often goes unnoticed while providing top quality service can only be 
       achieved through proper discipline. 
       Students with good observational skills are very important. In order to provide customised service 
       and to understand what kind of service does one each individual requires one  needs to understand the 
       requirements. Customers will not ask for everything but it is the duty of the hotel manager to 
       understand that. This can only be possible with proper observation skills.
       Students must be prepared for working hard for long hours and often in odd hours. In order to be ready 
       with breakfast, the preparation needs to start well before the breakfast hours. Same goes for all other 
       services. 
       Students who are interested in different cultures and have a good understanding of it is very beneficial. 
       All customers will not be the same and have the same culture thus it is important to understand the 
       culture that every individual comes from. Good observation skills and proper knowledge about different 
       cultures will help the students provide better service.</p>
